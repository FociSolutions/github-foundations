# Github Foundations

A framework to setup a secure Github Enterprise account quickly. Github foundations is organized into 2 layers:

1. [bootstrap](./bootstrap/README.md)
2. [organizations](./organizations/README.md)

There are instructions at each layer for how to use it. Users should start at the bootstrap layer, then the organizations layer.
