## Mandatory Requirements

## Additional Considerations

| Activity  | Validation |
| --- | --- |
|  Integrate the SCM with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to centralize log analysis and alerting.| <ul><li>Provide evidence that the SCM is integrated with a SIEM system to centralize log analysis and alerting.</li></ul> |
| Have a plan in place for responding to security incidents detected through monitoring, including roles and responsibilities, communication plans, and recovery procedures. | <ul><li>Provide evidence that a plan is in place for responding to security incidents detected through monitoring, including roles and responsibilities, communication plans, and recovery procedures.</li></ul> |
